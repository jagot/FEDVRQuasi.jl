Implementation of the finite-element, discrete-variable representation
method using the [[https://github.com/JuliaApproximation/ContinuumArrays.jl][ContinuumArrays.jl]] approach. It is intended that this
approach will eventually replace the one in [[https://github.com/jagot/FEDVR.jl][FEDVR.jl]].

TODO:
- [-] Fix derivatives
  - [X] Bandwidths
  - [ ] Incompatible axes
  - [ ] Ensure complex scaling is correct for derivatives
- [ ] Boundary conditions (removing first/last basis function)
